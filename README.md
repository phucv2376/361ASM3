Project Overview
This project is focused on implementing and comparing different search algorithms for route-finding between cities. The program allows users to input a starting city and a destination city, select a search method from a set of common algorithms, and then returns the route (if any) between the two cities. The project involves both blind (uninformed) and heuristic (informed) search methods.

The main search algorithms implemented in this project are:
  * Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  * Depth-First Search (DFS)
  * Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (ID-DFS)
  * Best-First Search
  * A* Search

The project will measure the time taken to find a route and the total distance covered between nodes (cities),
